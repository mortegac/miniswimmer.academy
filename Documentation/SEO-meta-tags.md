# Open Graph tags

They are labels created to publish content on social networks


## og:title
The title of your page.

Syntax
```<meta property="og:title" content="Open Graph Meta Tags: Everything You Need to Know" />```

Best practices
- Add it to all “shareable” pages.
- Focus on accuracy, value, and clickability.
- Keep it short to prevent overflow. There’s no official guidance on this, but 40 characters for mobile and 60 for desktop is roughly the sweet spot.
- Use the raw title. Don’t include branding (e.g., your site name).

## og:url
The URL of the content.

Syntax
```<meta property="og:url" content="https://ahrefs.com/blog/open-graph-meta-tags/" />```

Best practices
- Use the canonical URL. It helps consolidate all connected data, such as likes, across all the duplicate URLs posted.

## og:image
The URL of an image for the social snippet.

Note that this is perhaps the most essential Open Graph tag because it occupies the most social feed real estate.

Syntax
```<meta property="og:image" content="https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fb-open-graph-1.jpg" />```

Best practices
- Use custom images for “shareable” pages (e.g., homepage, articles, etc.)
- Use your logo or any other branded image for the rest of your pages.
- Use images with a 1.91:1 ratio and minimum recommended dimensions of 1200x630 for optimal clarity across all devices.

## og:type
The type of object you’re sharing. (e.g., article, website, etc.)

Syntax
```<meta property="og:type" content="article" />```

Best practices
- Use article for articles and website for the rest of your pages.
- Describe object types further where appropriate (optional).

## og:description
A brief description of the content. 

Syntax
```<meta property="og:description" content="Learn about 13 features that set Ahrefs apart from the competition." />```
Best practices
- Complement the title to make the snippet as appealing and click-worthy as possible.
- Copy your meta description here if it makes sense. 
- Keep it short and sweet. Facebook recommends 2-4 sentences, but that often truncates.

## og:locale
Defines the content language.

Syntax
```<meta property="og:locale" content="en_GB" />```
Best practices
- Use only for content not written in American English (en_US). Facebook assumes content without this tag is written in this language.
